# DCAS19502006.DAT

This dataset contains the records of U.S. military personnel casualties for deaths between the years 1950 and 2005, 
and two records of deaths related to Vietnam that occurred in 2006. 
The casualties occurred worldwide and resulted from both hostile and non-hostile action. 
The war or conflict for each casualty is identified as occurring during the Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, War on Terrorism, 
or Peacetime. Because of the broad nature of the category of Peacetime, 
several fields further describe those casualties in terms of location, circumstances, category, and reason. 
Each record includes such information as: the service member's name, service number, service branch, rank, pay grade, 
occupation, birth date, gender, home of record (city, county, state or province, country), marital status, religion, race, 
ethnicity, casualty circumstances, casualty location (city, state or province, country or over water), 
unit, duty, process date, death date, war or conflict, operation incident type, aircraft type, hostile or non-hostile death indicator, 
casualty type, and casualty category. Since this is the public use version of the file, the service number field is masked.
